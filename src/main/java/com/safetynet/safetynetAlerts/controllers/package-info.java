/**
 * This package contains the controllers of the application, which handle HTTP requests and
 * produce HTTP responses.
 * <p>
 * They are annotated with Spring's `@RestController` or `@Controller`
 * annotations to indicate that they are capable of handling web requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Controllers utilize various annotations and features provided by Spring
 * MVC, such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, `@PatchMapping`,
 * `@RequestBody`, `@RequestParam`, `@PathVariable`, and others, to define the mappings
 * between HTTP requests and Java methods.
 * </p>
