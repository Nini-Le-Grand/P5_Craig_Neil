/**
 * This package contains model classes that represent the data structures used within the application.
 * These models serve as Java representations of data objects manipulated by the system.
 * <p>
 * The models encapsulate the properties and behaviors associated with different types of data object,
 * such as persons, medical records, fire stations, and API data transfer objects (DTOs).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The model classes implement Lombok annotations for generating
 * boilerplate code, and validation annotations for enforcing data integrity rules.
 * </p>
